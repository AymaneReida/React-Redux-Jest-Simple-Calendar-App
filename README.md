React Redux Jest Simple Calendar Application

This component is a reusable calendar with any year and month.
You can add an event to your calendar by clicking on a day of it.
You can close your form either by clicking the cancel button or the escape key on your keyboard.
The year used in this example comes from the <Year(<Month31>)> function,
to display the month of January with the first day being Sunday.
You must be careful if you want to use this last feature,
you must enter the same month in the argument of the <Year(<Month31>)>
function as in the (props) "month" and must have 31 days.
